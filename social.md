Social Points System Overview

Each character has a pool of Social Points (SP), similar to Action Points or Effort Points. These points represent a character's ability to influence others, win friends, and come out on top in social situations. SP can be spent to gain bonuses on social skill checks, activate special social maneuvers, and resist social pressure from others.

Characters recover all of their SP after an extended pause. In addition, they recover a number of SP equal to their Charisma modifier after a pause. If a character's SP drops to zero, they become socially Exhausted and suffer a disadvantage on all social skill checks until they rest or pause.
