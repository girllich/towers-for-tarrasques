# Combat

The goal of combat is to use your tactics effectively to defeat your enemies, using a combination of movement, attacks, and abilities to outmaneuver and outsmart them. The players can also use teamwork, tactics and strategy to overcome the challenges they face.

## Reactions

"Reaction": The order in which characters take their turns in combat, determined by their Reaction score. Your reaction is the highest of your Class Scores + 2d20. Reroll this each combat.

## Timeblocks

In this RPG, time is divided into "Timeblocks", which are similar to rounds in other RPGs. During a Timeblock, each character has 9 Points" (AP) to spend on various actions.

Each action a character takes costs a certain amount of AP, but the cost may vary depending on their Ancestry. For example, moving may cost 1 AP for an Nimbles Ancestry and 2 AP for a Giants Ancestry.

Some actions may have additional costs, such as rolling for "Perception" to spot a hidden object or rolling for "Stealth" to move unseen.

Characters can choose to spend all of their AP in one Timeblock or save some for future Timeblocks.

Keep in mind that the amount of AP a character has, and how it is spent, can greatly affect the outcome of combat, and should be considered carefully when making decisions during a fight.

The GD will have the final say on the AP cost of actions, based on the situation and context.

## Action Point Costs

Movement: Moving one or a series of short distances during your turn, up to your speed in paces, costs 3 AP.

Attack: Making a basic melee or ranged attack costs 5 AP. Additional costs may apply for certain weapons or special abilities. Ancestries such as Nimbles may have a reduced cost for attacks, while others such as Giants may have an increased cost.

Defend: Using an action to brace for an incoming attack or take cover behind an obstacle costs 2 AP.

Feint: Using an action to deceive an opponent and gain an advantage in combat costs 2 AP.

Spellcasting: The cost of spellcasting varies based on the complexity and power of the spell being casted. The cost of spellcasting can be decided by the GD, but it should be kept in mind that powerful spells will cost more AP than simple spells.

Use Item: Using an item, such as a potion or tool, costs 1 AP.

Use Skill: Attempting to use a skill, such as "Perception" to spot a hidden object or "Stealth" to move unseen, costs 1 AP.

Open door: Opening, or trying to open a normal door costs 1 AP.

### Spellcasting

spellcasting can cost a variable amount of Action Points (AP) depending on the complexity and power of the spell being casted. Some spells may have a base cost of 3 AP, while others may cost 5 or more. The GD can adjust the costs of spellcasting based on the situation and context.

For example:

A low-level spell, such as a basic healing spell, may cost 3 AP to cast.
A high-level spell, such as a spell that does massive damage, may cost 8 AP to cast.
A spell that is unique to a particular Ancestry or Calling may cost less or more AP to cast.

### Interrupts:

Some actions and abilities allow characters to take an interrupt action. These interrupts are taken in response to a specific trigger, such as an enemy's attack or spell.
Interrupts can be used to disrupt an opponent's action, defend against an incoming attack, or to gain an advantage in combat.
Interrupts may cost AP, but the cost varies depending on the specific interrupt and the character's Ancestry and Calling.
Interrupts can be used to dodge, parry or block an incoming attack.
Interrupts can be used to make a saving throw against a spell or other effect.

### Interrupt Strike:

An Interrupt Strike is a special type of interrupt that can be taken when an opponent leaves an opening in their defenses.
Characters that are trained in combat and have the ability to take Interrupt Strikes can make an attack against an opponent who moves out of a protected zone without using the shift action or if an opponent within their reach uses a ranged weapon.
The Interrupt Strike costs 1 AP. Characters with the ability to make Interrupt Strikes can make them even if they have already used all of their AP for the turn. 

## Before Combat

Before Combat:

Each character starts with 9 AP at the start of the first timeblock, and at the top of each subsequent timeblock. These AP can't be used until it's the character's turn unless you're using an interrupt.
Before their first turn, players roll for Readiness to determine the order of actions during the first timeblock of combat.
Players may choose to spend some of their AP to increase their Readiness roll before combat begins.
Surprise:

If a character or group is surprised, they may not spend AP on their first timeblock of combat.
If a character or group manages to surprise their opponents, they may spend AP as they see fit on their first timeblock of combat.
In this example, the players have a limited amount of AP per turn, which is 9, and they must use them wisely to move, attack, defend, cast spells and any other action they want to perform. Also, they have the option to increase their Readiness roll by spending some of their AP.

It's important to note that the game director (GD) can adjust the amount of AP per turn, and the costs of actions, depending on their vision of the game.

## During Combat

Roll for readiness at the start of combat: Each character rolls a d20 and adds their Awareness score. The character with the highest total goes first.

Determine Action Points (AP): At the start of each turn, each character receives 9 AP. These can be used for various actions such as moving, attacking, and casting spells.

Take actions: Each character takes their turn in order of readiness, using their AP to perform various actions. For example, a character may move up to their speed in paces, make an attack, or cast a spell.

Resolve Interrupts: Characters may take interrupts as a reaction to certain triggers such as an enemy's attack or spell. Interrupts can be used to disrupt an opponent's action, defend against an incoming attack, or to gain an advantage in combat.

End of turn: Once all characters have taken their turn, the round ends and the next round begins with step 2.

Repeat until combat ends: Combat continues until one side is defeated or until the characters and the GD decide to end it.

## Movement

Movement in this RPG is measured in "paces". A pace is roughly equivalent to one-and-one-half yards, or 150 centimeters. 

Characters can move a number of paces depending on their Ancestry and Calling. For example, a Nimbles Ancestry may move faster than a Giants Ancestry. A Blademaster Calling may move differently than a Soulbinder Calling.

Characters can move in any direction, including diagonally. They can also move through difficult terrain, such as underbrush or over rocky ground, at a reduced pace.

Characters can be in a variety of positions such as standing, crouching, and laying. These positions can affect the character's ability to defend and attack.

Keep in mind that movement and positioning can greatly affect the outcome of combat, and should be considered carefully when making decisions during a fight.

### 3D Movement

In addition to movement on the ground, characters in this RPG can also move in three dimensions, allowing them to climb, fly, and swim.

Climbing: Characters can climb surfaces such as walls and cliffs using their "Endurance" score and a roll for "Climbing". The GD will set the threshold for the climb based on the difficulty of the surface.

Flying: Characters with the ability to fly, such as certain Ancestries or Callings, can move through the air. Their speed and maneuverability are determined by their "Finesse" score and a roll for "Flying".

Swimming: Characters can swim in water using their "Endurance" score and a roll for "Swimming". The GD will set the threshold based on the difficulty of the current.

Keep in mind that movement in three dimensions can greatly affect the outcome of combat, and should be considered carefully when making decisions during a fight.

### How to attack

Action Point cost: Making an attack costs 5 Action Points (AP).

Attack roll: To make an attack, roll a d20 and add your Finesse or Might score. The total is compared to the target's Defense. If your roll equals or exceeds the target's defense, the attack hits.

Damage roll: If the attack hits, roll a damage die appropriate to your weapon or spell and add your Finesse or Might score. The total is subtracted from the target's hit points.

Special effects: Some weapons or spells have special effects such as inflicting status effects or bypassing certain types of defenses.

Critical hits: If the attack roll is a natural 20, it is considered a critical hit and the damage dealt is doubled.

Ancestry and Calling: Ancestry and Calling can affect the attack roll, the damage roll, and the action point cost of the action.

### Weapon Damage

Damage dice: The damage dealt by a weapon is determined by rolling a set of dice. Each weapon has a specific set of damage dice, such as 2d4, 2d6, or 2d8.

Base damage: The base damage of a weapon is determined by the type of weapon. For example, a dagger might deal 2d4 damage, while a greatsword might deal 2d8 damage.

Ancestry and Calling: Ancestry and Calling can affect the damage dealt by a weapon. For example, a Dragonkin using a sword might deal an extra 1d4 damage, while a Feyblood using a bow might deal an extra 1d6 damage.

Special weapons: Some weapons have special abilities or properties that are not reflected in their damage dice. For example, a weapon may have a chance to stun the target or deal extra damage to a specific type of enemy. Here's some examples:

- "Eclipse Staff" : A staff imbued with dark magic, it deals 2d6 damage and has the ability to drain the life of the target
- "Gravity Blade" : A sword that manipulates gravity to increase its cutting power, it deals 2d8 damage and has a chance to knock the target off balance
- "Frostbite Gauntlets" : Gauntlets that can freeze the air around them, they deal 2d6 damage and have a chance to freeze the target in place
- "Vortex Shield" : A shield that can create a vacuum, it deals 2d4 damage and has a chance to suck the target in
- "Thunderbolt Bow" : A bow that can shoot lightning bolts, it deals 2d6 damage and has a chance to stun the target

Normal Weapons:

- "Hammerfist" : A gauntlet with a built-in hammer weight. It deals 2d6 Hard damage.
