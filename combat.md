# Combat

The goal of combat is to use your tactics effectively to defeat your enemies, using a combination of movement, attacks, and abilities to outmaneuver and outsmart them. The players can also use teamwork, tactics and strategy to overcome the challenges they face.


# Reactions

"Reaction": The order in which characters take their turns in combat, determined by their Reaction score. Your reaction is the highest of your Class Scores + 2d20. Reroll this each combat.


# Timeblocks

Combat is divided into "Timeblocks", similar to rounds in D&D. During each Timeblock, each player character has two Tactics that they can take, which can be Physical or Mental in nature. Examples of Physical Tactics include: "Move", "Attack", "Defend" and "Feint". Examples of Mental Tactics include: "Cast Spell", "Use Ability", "Concentrate on a Spell" and "Use an item"

On a player's turn, they can choose to use their two Tactics to move, attack, defend, feint or use abilities, or a combination of these actions, depending on their class and abilities. After all players have taken their turn, the Timeblock ends, and a new one begins, starting with the player with the highest Reaction.
