# Physical Combat

The goal of combat is to use your tactics effectively to defeat your enemies, using a combination of movement, attacks, and abilities to outmaneuver and outsmart them. The players can also use teamwork, tactics and strategy to overcome the challenges they face.

### Interrupts:

Some actions and abilities allow characters to take an interrupt action. These interrupts are taken in response to a specific trigger, such as an enemy's attack or spell. Interrupts can be used to disrupt an opponent's action, defend against an incoming attack, or to gain an advantage in combat. Interrupts may cost AP. Interrupts can be used to dodge, parry or block an incoming attack. Interrupts can be used to make a saving throw against a spell or other effect.

### Interrupt Strike:

An Interrupt Strike is a special type of interrupt that can be taken when an opponent leaves an opening in their defenses.
Characters that are trained in combat and have the ability to take Interrupt Strikes can make an attack against an opponent who moves out of a protected zone without using the shift action or if an opponent within their reach uses a ranged weapon.
The Interrupt Strike costs 1 AP. Characters with the ability to make Interrupt Strikes can make them even if they have already used all of their AP for the turn. 

## Before Combat

Before Combat:

Each character starts with 7 AP at the start of the first timeblock, and at the top of each subsequent timeblock. These AP can't be used until it's the character's turn unless you're using an interrupt. Before their first turn, players roll for Readiness to determine the order of actions during the first timeblock of combat.Players may choose to spend some of their AP to increase their Readiness roll before combat begins.

Surprise:

If a character or group is surprised, they may not spend AP on their first timeblock of combat.
If a character or group manages to surprise their opponents, they may spend AP as they see fit on their first timeblock of combat.
In this example, the players have a limited amount of AP per turn, which is 9, and they must use them wisely to move, attack, defend, cast spells and any other action they want to perform. Also, they have the option to increase their Readiness roll by spending some of their AP.
