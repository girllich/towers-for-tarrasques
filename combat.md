# Combat

The goal of combat is to use your tactics effectively to defeat your enemies, using a combination of movement, attacks, and abilities to outmaneuver and outsmart them. The players can also use teamwork, tactics and strategy to overcome the challenges they face.


## Reactions

"Reaction": The order in which characters take their turns in combat, determined by their Reaction score. Your reaction is the highest of your Class Scores + 2d20. Reroll this each combat.

## Timeblocks

Combat is divided into "Timeblocks". During each Timeblock, each player character has two Tactics that they can take, which can be Physical or Mental in nature. Examples of Physical Tactics include: "Move", "Attack", "Defend" and "Feint". Examples of Mental Tactics include: "Cast Spell", "Use Ability", "Concentrate on a Spell" and "Use an item"

On a player's turn, they can choose to use their two Tactics to move, attack, defend, feint or use abilities, or a combination of these actions, depending on their class and abilities. After all players have taken their turn, the Timeblock ends, and a new one begins, starting with the player with the highest Reaction.

## Definitions

- "Move": Allows the character to move a certain distance on the battlefield, either to get closer to an enemy or to reposition themselves for a better tactical advantage. The distance you can move is determined by your ancestry and calling.
- "Attack": Allows the character to make a physical attack on an enemy, using a weapon or their own body. The attack roll is determined by the character's physical scores and the weapon's proficiency bonus
- "Defend": Allows the character to increase their defense, either by raising a shield, dodging or parrying. The defense roll is determined by the character's physical scores and the shield's proficiency bonus
- "Feint": Allows the character to deceive an opponent into leaving an opening, providing benefits to the next attack against them. The feint roll is determined by the character's Finesse score
- "Cast a spell": Allows the character to cast a spell, using their magic to affect the battlefield in various ways. The spell roll is determined by the Spellcasting Ability of the character. 
- "Use an ability": Allows the character to use a special ability, either from their class or from a magic item. The ability roll is determined by the character's scores that are relevant to the ability.
- "Concentrate on a spell": Allows the character to maintain concentration on a spell, either to keep it active or to make it more powerful. The concentration roll is determined by the character's Insight score and the character's proficiency in spellcasting.
- "Use an item": Allows the character to use an item, such as a potion or a scroll, to gain an advantage in combat. The item roll is determined by the character's scores that are relevant to the item.

## How to do it

- Determine the order of combat using the "Readiness" score. The character with the highest Readiness goes first, followed by the character with the next highest, and so on.

- Each character takes their turn in order of "Readiness" score. During their turn, a character can take two Tactics. The character can choose to move, attack, defend, feint, cast a spell, use an ability, concentrate on a spell or use an item as their tactics.

- Roll for attack, defense, feint, spell, ability, concentration and item usage using the relevant ability score, if required.

- Resolve the effects of the Tactics. For example, if the character chooses to attack, roll to hit and damage, and apply the damage to the target.

- Once all characters have taken their turn, the Timeblock ends and a new one begins, starting with the character with the highest Readiness score.

- Repeat steps 2-6 until the combat is over.

- Keep track of hit points, if applicable, and any other effects that last for more than one Timeblock.
