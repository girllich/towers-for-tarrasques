In character creation, each player chooses 3-5 boxes to define their character's abilities, traits, and backstory. Each box provides various bonuses to their statistics, skills, and resources, allowing players to mix and match to create a unique character. The contents of each box can be determined using dice rolls, adding an element of chance to character creation. Some boxes have prerequisites, meaning they require another specific box to be chosen first.
