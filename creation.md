A Box is a collection of skills, stats, abilities, and traits that define a character's strengths, expertise, and role in the game world. Each Box has a cost, typically one Box Point, which determines how many Boxes a character can have.

During character creation, players choose from a variety of Boxes that represent different archetypes or roles, such as a "Strong" character with high strength and lifting skills, an "Apprentice Mage" with basic magic powers and high intelligence, or a "Fast" character with extra action points. The choice of Boxes defines the starting abilities and traits of the character and sets the path for their future development.

As players advance their characters through gameplay, they can acquire additional Boxes, representing new skills, abilities, and experiences gained through their adventures. For example, an "Apprentice Mage" might later become an "Intermediate Mage" or even a "Master Mage", acquiring more powerful spells and greater magical prowess.

Some Boxes also come with specific requirements or prerequisites. For instance, to become a "Master Mage", a character must first have the "Intermediate Mage" Box. Other Boxes, like the "Dragon" or "Vampire", come with a higher cost, reflecting their significant power and influence in the game world.

Boxes aren't just about combat and abilities, however. They can also reflect a character's social status, wealth, connections, or other aspects of their background or personality. For instance, the "Wealth" or "History of Wealth" Boxes grant the character a comfortable lifestyle, a large house, and numerous social contacts. The "Settled" Box gives a character a place to call home and a network of local contacts.

Characters can form connections with loyal allies, magical familiars, and majestic mounts. These companions are represented by Companion Points (CP). A character can have any number of companions, as long as the total CP cost does not exceed their maximum CP.

Companion Points are used to acquire and upgrade companions. Some companions, like a Trusted Squire or a Magical Familiar, require only a small investment of CP, while more powerful or versatile companions like a Griffon Mount, require a larger amount of CP.

Companion Points can be gained through character creation boxes, such as the "Leader" or "Ranger" boxes, or may be acquired through gameplay as the result of a quest, reward, or significant character development.

Different types of companions offer different benefits. An animal companion like a Fierce Hound or Noble Hawk can aid in combat, track enemies, or scout ahead. A mount like a Riding Horse or Holy Mount can dramatically reduce travel times. A familiar like a Fey Sprite or Arcane Construct can offer magical abilities or serve as a scout or spy. More mundane companions like a Pack Mule or a Scribe can carry equipment, perform tasks, or assist with research and record-keeping.

However, companions also come with responsibilities. They must be cared for, protected, and in some cases, commanded or controlled. Some companions may also have their own personalities, goals, or complications, which can add additional depth and role-playing opportunities to the game.

While players are free to play each others' companions, hirelings etc, certain roles and actions are limited to the character that owns the companion. For example, only the owner can give commands to a companion, and some companions may refuse to perform certain actions or behave in certain ways based on their nature or personality.

Players should discuss and agree on the role and behavior of companions in the game to ensure a fun and balanced experience for everyone. Whether they are used for combat, exploration, or role-playing, companions can add an extra dimension to your RPG adventure
