# Shapeshifters

- Shapeshifters can spend 2 Action Points to shapeshift into or out of their chosen animal form. This form cannot be one that is larger than 8 feet tall, and has to be approved by the Game Director. Shapeshifters retain their mental abilities when shapeshifted, but gain the physical ability scores of the animal.

The Shapeshifters, also known as the Morphs, are a unique and versatile ancestry that possess the ability to change their physical form. Though their shifting abilities are limited to specific animal forms, such as a wolf, bear, or eagle, they are able to maintain their intelligence and memories while transformed. Their shifting abilities grant them natural weapons and improved senses, but also come at a cost, as they must periodically return to their humanoid form or risk becoming trapped in their animal form permanently.  After spending an extended period of time in animal form, shapeshifters may develop physical attributes of their chosen animal, such as cat ears or a tail.

## Age:
Shapeshifters age at the same rate as humans. They reach maturity at around 18 years of age and can live up to 80 years.

## Languages:
Shapeshifters are able to speak, read, and write Common. As they spend more time in their animal form, they may also learn to speak to the animal they are shapeshifting into.

## Size:
In their natural form, Shapeshifters are smaller than humans, 3-5 feet in height. However, when they are shapeshifting into an animal form, they take on the size of that animal. For example, if they shapeshift into a wolf, they would be the size of a wolf.

## Speed:
In their natural form, Shapeshifters have a base speed of 30 paces per round. However, when they are shapeshifting into an animal form, they take on the speed of that animal. For example, if they shapeshift into a cheetah, they would be able to move at a much faster pace.
