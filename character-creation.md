# Innate Abilities

Innate abilities represent the natural talents and abilities of a character. They include "Might", "Finesse", "Resilience", "Insight", "Awareness", and "Presence". These scores are used to determine a character's skills, resistance checks, and ability to perform certain tasks.

## Creation Point Buy

Each player starts with a set number of creation points to spend on their ability scores. You could give each player 75 creation points to spend, for example.

Each score within the range has a point value assigned to it. For example:

- 3: -10 creation points
- 4-5: -8 creation points
- 6-7: -6 creation points
- 8-9: -4 creation points
- 10-11: -2 creation points
- 12-13: 0 creation points
- 14-15: 2 creation points
- 16-17: 4 creation points
- 18: 6 creation points
- 19-20: 8 creation points
- 21-22: 10 creation points
- 23-24: 12 creation points
- 25-26: 14 creation points
- 27-28: 16 creation points
- 28-29: 18 creation points
- 30: 20 creation points

Players can then spend their creation points to raise their ability scores. For example, if a player wants to have an "Might" of 25, they would need to spend 14 creation points. 

## Dice Roll

roll 5d6 and drop the lowest value. This way, the minimum score would be 4 (if you roll all 1's) and the maximum score would be 24 (if you roll all 6's) and it gives a range of 4-24. If the sum of your rolls is not more than 100, double the lowest. 

## Resistance Checks

"Resistance Checks" test their ability to resist external forces that could harm them, such as spells, traps, or environmental hazards. The value of your resistance check is 1/4 of your Innate Ability added to your Level Bonus

# Vitality Points

Each Ancestry starts with a different number of Vitality Points. Further vitality points will be determined by your Calling

- Nimbles: Roll a 2d8+6 to determine their starting Vitality Points.
- Stonelords: Roll 2d10+6 to determine their starting Vitality Points.
- Elders: Roll 1d12+6 to determine their starting Vitality Points.
