When a character's Effort Points fall below zero, all actions that cost Action Points require an additional Action Point to perform, and all efforts that cost Effort Points require an additional Effort Point. This represents the strain of pushing beyond one's normal limits. If a character cannot pay the increased cost of an action, they cannot perform that action until they have rested and their Effort Points are above zero again.
