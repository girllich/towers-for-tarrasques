| Activity | Description | Effort Point Cost |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Treat Wounds | Provide first aid or longer-term medical care to an injured person | 15 Points |
| Craft Item | Create a simple item, such as a tool or weapon. More complex items might require more points | 20 Points |
| Forage | Search the wilderness for edible plants or hunt small game sufficient for meals | 25 Points |
| Cook Meal | Prepare a hearty meal using available ingredients | 10 Points |
| Set Camp | Find a suitable location and set up a campsite | 10 Points |
| Study/Research | Learn new information or gain insight on a topic | 25 Points |
| Repair Equipment | Repair damaged equipment, such as weapons or armor | 10 Points |
| Navigate | Determine the party's location and the best route to their destination | 5 Points |
| Keep Watch | Stay alert for potential threats while the rest of the party rests | 10 Points |
| Engage in Combat | Participate in a round of life-or-death physical combat | 5 Points |

For every additional Effort Point spent on an effort, the character gets a +1 bonus to the roll to determine the success of that effort. Note that spending additional points in this way increases the chance of success, but it does not guarantee it.

| Rest Type | Description | Effort Points Restored |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| Stopping | A brief pause |  2 Point per ten minutes, up to one hours |
| Sleeping | Enough sleep | 15 points per hour, up to ten hours |
| Eating | Enough food | 20 points per full meal, 30 minutes, max 3 times a day |

When a character's Effort Points fall below zero, all actions that cost Action Points require an additional Action Point to perform, and all efforts that cost Effort Points require an additional Effort Point. This represents the strain of pushing beyond one's normal limits.
