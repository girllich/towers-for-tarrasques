# Blademaster

- Rank 1: "Precision Strike": The Blademaster can focus their attacks to deal extra damage to a specific body part of their target, increasing the chance of a Great Hit. 
- Rank 2: "Bladestorm": The Blademaster can enter a state of frenzy, allowing them to make multiple attacks in quick succession at the cost of reduced accuracy. This allows a blademaster to take a physical attack for only 3 AP, at the cost of their attacks being less accurate- there's a penalty of -3 to the attack roll. A Nimble Blademaster can make attacks for only 2 AP, but their attacks are even more inaccurate- the penalty doubles. 
- Rank 3: "Master's Parry": The Blademaster can anticipate and deflect incoming attacks with exceptional skill, gaining temporary hit points and a chance to counterattack. Each time they you attacked by an enemy and you have remaining AP, you can perform an immediate attack at -3, at the cost of 1AP.
